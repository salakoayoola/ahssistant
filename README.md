Little pockets of success stories from my Home Server experiment

## Closet / Bathroom Integrations
 #### Beko Washing Machine

![Beko HA card - running](https://github.com/salakoayoola/ahssistant/blob/main/images/Cottons%20Rinsing.png?raw=true)
Inspired by [My Smart Home's](https://youtu.be/_aoO5CdymaE?si=VxxMwIuEEPEtWo3Y) Washing Machine card, I tried to recreate the card, specifically for the Beko 742xxxy series

The difference in the tutorial and this specific model are the number of entities.
* Connect the Washing Machine with the HomeWhiz mobile app
* Integrate HomeWhiz and by extension the washing machine [to HomeAssistant](https://github.com/home-assistant-HomeWhiz/home-assistant-HomeWhiz).

This specific model has multiple sensor entities, instead of one, hence the change in approach
